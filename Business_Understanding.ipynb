    "Erasmus MC is a university medical center located in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. This UMC is the academic hospital and medical faculty of Erasmus University Rotterdam. It specializes in various medical disciplines and consists of 50 medical and scientific departments. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Erasmus MC (2023), the hospital identifies three core tasks: patient care, education and training, valorization and scientific research. The mission Erasmus MC is working towards is a healthy population and excellent care through research and education. Its ambitions follow from the vision of recognized leadership in innovations for health and care. In total, almost 17 thousant employees and more than 4 thousand students work at Erasmus MC. The UMC is known for its expertise and has 56 recognized centers for treating rare diseases. In addition, they participated in 23 of the 24 European Reference Networks: a network between healthcare organization in the EU intended to communicate about rare diseases and conditions that require specialized knowledge and resources (European Commission, n.d.).\n",

    "This project takes place within the Neurology department, but has overlap with Sophia's Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). The data used in the project is from patients admitted to the PICU. Patients aged 0 to 18 with an (acute) life-threatening condition are treated here. The function of the brain, breathing and blood circulation are continuously monitored. According to Erasmus MC (2022), their PICU is among the top 5 in Europe in the field of research, patient care, and education. The department has 36 beds spread over 5 units: Cardiology, Neurology, Neonatal, ECMO and High Care. The High Care unit offers 7 more beds. The PICU consults with other departments, including Neurology, where neurologists monitor and review EEGs. "

    "- Medical professionals. This stakeholder group includes the project's supervisor Robert van den Berg (neurologist/clinical neurophysiologist). With their expertise, results of the process and the model are assessed and validated. Their insights and help are essential for the research.\n",
    "- Research suite Erasmus MC (including Syntho). This facility may be able to help with data augmentation and synthetization. An initiative has recently been started in collaboration with Erasmus MC and the company Syntho about generating artificial data. \n",
    "- Patients and loved ones. The patients themselves, their families, friends, or others involved are important stakeholders. The research may have direct consequences for treatment in the long term, which affects health outcomes. \n",
    "- HZ University of Applied Sciences. The university is a partner because the research is carried out as a part of the HBO-ICT study programme. The school, teachers, and Data Science Lectoraat can contribute to the methodological, technical, and scientific aspects of the research.

    "**Problem area**\n",
    "\n",
    " Electroencephalography (EEG) is the primary tool for diagnosing epilepsy. The technique measures electrical activity in the brain, which is then assessed by neurologists to determine if certain abnormalities can be observed. Detecting epileptic seizures can be a challenging task, as it demands time-consuming manual assessment from physicians. Depending on the type of seizure, it may manifest differently on an EEG. Seizures can involve changes in frequency, pattern, and location (Hirsch et al., 2021). During continuous brain function monitoring, which is common in Intensive Care Units, physicians have to assess days of recordings. Depending on the situation, they may monitor the EEG real-time or at periodic intervals, such as hourly checks. Despite the expertise of neurologists, the assessment of an EEG is not devoid of interpretive inconsistencies. \"Because there is no gold standard for EEG interpretations, true accuracy cannot be measured.\" (Grant et al., 2014). This is especially problematic when seizures go unnoticed in life-threatening cases, such as in comatose patients. Monitoring their function is a time-intensive task, especially when the seizures are clinically subtle, as some patients may not show an external reaction to the seizure in their state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the research endavors, protocols, and guidelines are tailored towards adult patients. This leaves a notable gap in the understanding and management of seizures in children, making it particularly concerning given the diffierences between the child's developing braing and the mature adult brain. This necessitates research efforts specifically for this patient group. Comatose children represent an even more vulnerable type of patient that requires specialized care and attention in the PICU. "

    "**Current solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous studies, Erasmus MC discovered that deep learning models can outperform classical machine learning models in some cases. While DL demonstrate impressive performance, its inherent lack of transparency poses a challenge for implementation, particularly in medical settings where understanding the rationale behind specific outputs is crucial. This is one of the reasons why researchers often focus on nonblack-box classifiers such as rnadom forest and decision trees. However, the question has been raised whether deep learning results could potentially uncover novel bio-markers. Perhaps there exist patterns or features that have yet to be identified, but are indicative of epileptic activity. This makes it interesting to further research the usage of DL algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research shows there are various approaches in applying deep learning for EEG analysis. Three reviews have been published that compile results from many articles in which DL is applied for tasks related to EEG data (Craik et al., 2019; Roy et al., 2019; Shoeibi et al.,\n",
    "2021). According to all three, the most common approaches in deep learning model architectures for EEG analysis are by far Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Although differing in favor across publications, other common architectures tend to be Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), CNN\n",
    "combinations, Autoencoders, and Deep Belief Networks. For seizure detection tasks the most common architectures are CNN, RNN and CNN-RNN combinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seizure detection studies show a strong preference for CNN models, which is the selected architecture for 45-55% of the reviewed papers by Craik et al. (2019) and Shoeibi et al. (2021). Unlike the other two reviews, the research done by Shoeibi et al. (2021) focuses specifically on the\n",
    "detection of epileptic seizures, rather than other EEG analysis or classification tasks. It is mentioned that models with 2D-CNN architectures, followed by 1D-CNN models, are most commonly used for seizure detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research by Ansari et al. (2019) for seizure detection presented a 2D-CNN and a random forest classifier to automatically optimize feature selection and binary classification. The EEG data used originates from Sophia’s neonatal ICU (Erasmus\n",
    "MC). 55 features are used in the algorithms, extracted from the frequency domain, time domain, and information theory. Performance metrics of the CNN were: AUC of 88%, recall of 82%, and specificity of 84%."

    "An implemented model that can detect seizures promises to not only alleviate the workload of staff, but also assist in decision-making processes, optimize bed occupancy and improve nursing workforce staffing. The last two are especialy important considering the increasing shortage of nurses in the Netherlands, as reported by the Capaciteitsorgaan (2022). The intake for POCU nurse training has been around 40 students per year in recent years, while they advise to have an intake of over 100 students per year. This indiated the already existing staff shortage, which is likely to worsen in the coming years. One nurse is currently needed for every 2-3 beds in the PICU. It emphasizes the need for technologies that can help with these problems. An implemented model would directly affect bed occupancy as well. If a system can confirm that seizures are not or no longer occuring in patients it could help to decide if patients can be moved to a less critical unit, freeing up beds for new patients at the PICU.
